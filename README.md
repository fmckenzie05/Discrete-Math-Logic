# Discrete-Math-Logic

This repository contains a Discrete Math project focused on implementing and visualizing Trie data structures, including Tries, Ternary Search Trees, and Radix Trees. These structures are optimized for efficient string storage and querying, with applications in autocomplete systems, spell checkers, and IP routing.

# Features 
Trie Implementation: Efficiently store and query strings with common prefixes.

Ternary Search Tree: Combine the low space overhead of binary search trees with the character-based efficiency of tries.

Radix Tree: Utilize path compression for reduced memory usage and faster lookups.

Interactive Visualization: Leverage Plotly to visualize the structure and operations of the Trie interactively.
